# Machine-Learning-Projects
These are some projects where i used some techniques of data-structuring, data visualization, algorithms applied on data to Predict, Classify, Cluster or to make a Recommendation System , such as K-nearest algorithm, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM, Linear and non Linear Regression, K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, Density-based Clustering, Content-based Recommendation (item-item recommendation systems), Collaborative Filtering (user-user/user-item recommendation system). Also i used some different libraries and eco-systems such as SciPy, SciKit, Pandas, NumPy ... all using the beautiful language Python. 
Some of these project like cancer detection, predicting economic trends, predicting customer churn, recommendation engines and others are included in this repository.
These Projects were the assignments to pass my IBM Machine Learning Certificate.
